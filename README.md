Project Summary:
Our project will be a program that implements social networking functions using the graph data structure. The user will be prompted with the display menu, from there you can login, create a user, display all users, and quit. Once you login you will be prompted with another display menu that allows you to show all friends/users, add friends, remove friends, show mutual friends, display friend/personal information, delete account, display help screen, and logout. This is all done using a struct called Person and two separate vectors (friends vector/ people vector). 

How to run:

The user will run this program through the terminal.

1) Download or Clone the Git reposotory to your downloads folder at https://github.com/bredtoshred/McKenzie_CSCI2270_FinalProject 

2) Open a new terminal window. 

3) Change your directory to the folder you just downloaded containing the files you just downloaded using the cd command.

4) Compile the code using g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp mockFacebook.cpp mockFacebook.h

5) Run the code using ./a.out

6) Follow the instructions to create a new account and explore the functionality of our program.

If you're having trouble with the program there are help screens available to answer your questions. IF you are having issues with there being no other users make sure you are using the text file of users we provided. If you continue to have issues email phillip.mckenzie@colorado.edu with your questions.
