Project Summary:
Our project will be a program that implements social networking functions using the graph data structure. The user will be prompted with the display menu, from there you can login, create a user, display all users, and quit. Once you login you will be prompted with another display menu that allows you to show all friends/users, add friends, remove friends, show mutual friends, display friend/personal information, delete account, display helpscreen, and logout. This is all done using a struct called Person and two seperate vectors (friends vector/ people vector). 

How to run:
The user must donwload four seperate files, including mockFacebook.h, mockFacebook.cpp, fbInfo1.txt, and main.cpp. If you're having trouble with the program there are helpscreens implemented in it. As well the problem could be with the text file if there are no users being displayed.

Dependencies:
Program will run through the virtual machine

System Requirements:
No additional system requirements.

Contributers:
Rhonda Hoenigman: Suggested additional methods, and suggested to work on this project instead of other ideas. 
Nick Moore: Suggested the mutual friends function, two seperate menus, with a login screen.
