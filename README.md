Project Summary:
Our project will be a program that implements social networking functions using the graph data structure. The user will be prompted with the display menu, from there you will be able to add friends, find mutual friends(display personal information), delete a friend, and create an account. The program will read in a text file of a list of friends with specific details about that person that will be individually stored as a "friend" struct.

Dependencies:
Program will run through the virtual machine

System Requirements:
No additional system requirements.

Contributers:
